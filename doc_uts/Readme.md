### Instructions of 2D mapping using libpointmatcher

This `readme.md` introduce my work in UTS, August 2018.

#### Prepare

First install basic libs, follow the instructions in [libpointmatcher](https://github.com/ethz-asl/libpointmatcher).

Then download or clone `[ethz_icp_mapping]`(https://github.com/ZJUYH/ethzasl_icp_mapping) in my GitHub.

Compile the downloaded code, and get your 2D rosbag. 

Actaully not all the code is needed. I only add some files in [ethzasl_gridmap_2d](https://github.com/ZJUYH/ethzasl_icp_mapping/tree/master/ethzasl_gridmap_2d) and fix something in [libpointmatcher_ros](https://github.com/ZJUYH/ethzasl_icp_mapping/tree/master/libpointmatcher_ros).

#### Get relative poses

##### Run


##### Some parameters and variants

#### Artificial loop closing

#### Liang's optimization

#### Mapping by alignment
